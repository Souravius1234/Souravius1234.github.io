									<h3 class="major">My Background!</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/img03.jpeg" alt="" /></span> I have always been interested in Research and Development, especially in topics related to Astrodynamics, GNC, and Space Transportation Systems. I began my journey with a small group called <b>Team Aeros</b>. It comprised of nearly 40 individuals, and we looked to participate at the International Planetary Aerial Systems Challenge (IPAS 2021), held by the Mars Society South Asia (MSSA). We finished fourth in the event after months of hardwork. The project report is available on the projects page of my website! <br><br> Following our participation in the event, I took interest in beginning a rocketry club in my university. We called it <b>Team Avadhi</b>. We tried participating at the annual <b>Spaceport America Cup</b> 2023 and 2024, but couldn't qualify for the event on both occasions. 
									Around the same time, I became a member of the Society of Automotive Engineers India (SAEIndia). We participated in <b>SAEIndia Aerothon 2023</b>. We were tasked to design a UAV capable of lifting a payload of 200 grams, while also operating autonomously and performing several specified tasks such as payload dropping and waypoint detection. We won a special prize for "Technical Presentation" during phase II of the event. Our team was named <b>Airhaven</b>!</p>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/img04.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I was also a part of the <b>IN-SPACe National CANSAT Competition 2022-24</b>, where we were tasked to design a satellite in the shape of a coke can, capable of taking measurements while descending with a parachute from 900m altitude. The event was conducted in association with the Indian Space Research Organization at Ahmedabad.</p>
									<p>Besides my technical experience working with Team Avadhi, Aeros and Airhaven, I also have gained valuable research experience by working with organizations like <b>Deep Space Initiative</b> and <b>Space Generation Advisory Council</b>. My work in those organizations will be published at the <b>75th International Astronautical Congress</b>, to be held at Milan this year! Besides these, I have published three conference papers and a journal paper. The most recent conference I attended was the <b>International Conference on Advances in Aerospace and Energy Systems (IAES-2024)</b>, held at the <b>Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, Indian Space Research Organization</b> at Valiamala, Thiruvananthapuram, India! </p>
									<p>I have also completed my <b>Bachelor's thesis</b> under the guidance of <b>Dr. Geethaikrishnan C</b>, the Deputy Director of the<b> Human Space Flight Center, ISRO</b>, Bengaluru, and <b>Mr. Gnani Ankathi</b>, Scientist 'C' at HSFC, ISRO!</p>
									<p>I will be joining <b>The University of Tokyo</b> from Fall 2024 for my graduate studies!</p>
